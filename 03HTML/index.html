        <h3>File Handling in Python</h3>
        <p>A file is a sequence of bytes on the disk/permanent storage where a group of related data is stored. File is created for permanent storage of data. In programming, Sometimes, it is not enough to only display the data on the console. Those data are to be retrieved later on,then the concept of file handling comes. It is impossible to recover the programmatically generated data again and again. However, if we need to do so, we may store it onto the file system which is not volatile and can be accessed every time. Here, comes the need of file handling in Python. File handling in Python enables us to create, update, read, and delete the files stored on the file system through our python program. The following operations can be performed on a file.</p>

        <h3>Idea of Algorithmic Efficiency</h3>
        <p>Efficient programming is a manner of programming that, when the program is executed, it uses a low amount of overall resources pertaining to specially computer hardware. A program is designed by a human being, and different human beings may use different algorithms, or sequences of codes, to perform particular tasks, so the efficiency of such different programs/algorithm varies, depend upon the number of resources being used. Practicing to create a low size(number of line of codes/number of operations) and low resource algorithm results in an efficient program.</p>

        <h3>Functions in TypeScript</h3>
        <p>

            Functions are the fundamental building blocks of any application in JavaScript. They're how you build up layers of abstraction, mimicking classes, information hiding, and modules.
        
            In TypeScript, while there are classes, namespaces, and modules, functions still play a key role in describing how to do things.
